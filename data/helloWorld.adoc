= Hello world notebook

Let's begin with a simple addition:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println("starting"); // remove this line to see the second block work well
int result = 1 + 1;
System.out.println("1 + 1 = " + result);
----

Now, let's use that variable again:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println("1 + 1 + 1 = " + (result + 1));
----

This is a better form of Jupyter notebooks.
